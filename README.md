# ES6 JavaScript

# ES6

ECMAScript 2015 or ES2015 is a significant update to the JavaScript programming language. It is the first major update to the language since ES5 which was standardized in 2009. Therefore, ES2015 is often called ES6.

To follow this ES6 tutorial, you should have a good knowledge of JavaScript up to ES5.

## Let, Var, Const

- Let:
    
    Declare block-scoped variables using the `let` keyword.
    
- Const:
    
    ES6 provides a new way of declaring a constant by using the `const` keyword. The `const` keyword creates a read-only reference to a value.
    

## Default Parameter

Default parameters allow you to set a default value for a parameter in a function. This means that if the function is called without a value for that parameter, the default value will be used instead.
